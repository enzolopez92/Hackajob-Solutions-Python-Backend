# Here's how the code works:

1. We initialize a list stack to represent the initial stack of movies, with the movies numbered from 1 to n in increasing order.
2. We initialize an empty list output to store the number of movies above each movie we want to watch.
3. We iterate through the list of movies movies that the client wants to watch.
4. For each movie, we find its index in the stack using the index() method.
5. We append the index to the output list, since the index represents the number of movies above the current movie in the stack.
6. We remove the movie from the stack using the pop() method with the index.
7. We add the movie back to the top of the stack using the insert() method with index 0.
8. After iterating through all the movies, we convert the output list to a comma-separated string using the join() method and the map() function to convert each integer to a string.
9. We return the comma-separated string movies_array.

The time complexity of this solution is O(m * n), where m is the number of movies to watch and n is the total number of movies in the stack. This is because for each movie we want to watch, we need to find its index in the stack, which takes O(n) time in the worst case.

The space complexity is O(n), since we need to store the entire stack of movies in memory.
