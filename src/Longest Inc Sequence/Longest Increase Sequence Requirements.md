# Longest Increase Sequence Requirements 

Given an integer sequence s = (s1,s2,s3,…,sn), a subsequence is another sequence s_ = (s_1, s_2, s_3…., s_k) with k < n, and s_1, s_2, s_3…, s_k belonging to s, exactly in that order.

Find the maximum length of a subsequence in which its elements are in increasing sorted order, lowest to highest. The subsequence doesn't have to be necessarily contigous, or unique.
