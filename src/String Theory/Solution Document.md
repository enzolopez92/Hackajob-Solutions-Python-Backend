# Solution Explanation

- This code defines a class Solution with a method run that takes a string p as input.
- The method run performs several manipulations on the input string p and returns a string containing combined queries separated by double colon (::).
- It first defines a string vowels containing all lowercase vowels.
- It then reverses the input string p and stores the result in reversed_p.
- Next, it reverses the cases of each word in the reversed string reversed_p and joins them with a space, storing the result in reversed_p_with_reversed_cases.
- After that, it inserts 'pv' before any vowel in the input string p, storing the result in p_with_pv.
- Then, it joins the words in the input string p with a dash - and stores the result in words_in_p.
- It counts the number of vowels and consonants in the input string p, storing the counts in nr_vowels and nr_consonants respectively.
- Finally, it combines all the queries into a single string combined_queries, separating them with double colon (::), and returns this string.

This code essentially performs various manipulations on the input string p and returns a string containing the results of these manipulations separated by double colons.
