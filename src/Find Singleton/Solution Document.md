# Solution Explanation

1. Class Definition:
class Solution: This defines a class named Solution. In Python, classes are used to define new types or categories of objects.
2. run Method:
- def run(self, student_list):: This defines a method named run within the Solution class. This method takes two parameters: self, which refers to the instance of the class itself, and student_list, which represents the list of students.
- single_student_number = 0: This initializes a variable named single_student_number to zero. This variable will be used to store the team number of the student with no partner.
- for student in student_list:: This is a loop that iterates over each element in the student_list. For each iteration, student represents the current element in the list, which is a team number.
- single_student_number ^= student: This line uses the bitwise XOR operator (^=) to update the single_student_number. XORing each team number with the current value of single_student_number will effectively cancel out pairs of team numbers, leaving only the team number of the student with no partner.
- return single_student_number: Once the loop completes, this line returns the final value of single_student_number, which represents the team number of the student with no partner.

In summary, the run method of the Solution class takes a list of student team numbers as input and efficiently finds the team number of the student with no partner using bitwise XOR operations.
