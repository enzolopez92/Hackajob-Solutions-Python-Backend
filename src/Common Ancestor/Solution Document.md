# Here's how the code works:

1. The 'depth' function calculates the depth of a node by repeatedly dividing its index by 2 and incrementing the depth until the index becomes 1 (the root).
2. The 'parent' function calculates the index of the parent of a node by dividing its index by 2.
3. We find the depths of the two input nodes using the depth function.
4. We move the deeper node up to the same depth as the other node by repeatedly calling the parent function and decrementing its depth.
5. After both nodes are at the same depth, we move them up the tree simultaneously by repeatedly calling the parent function until their indices become equal.
6. The index at which the two nodes meet is the index of their lowest common ancestor.
7. We return this index as index_common_ancestor.

The time complexity of this solution is O(log n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. 
This is because we need to traverse up the tree from the two input nodes to their common ancestor, and the maximum depth of a binary tree is O(log n).

The space complexity is O(1), since we are not allocating any additional data structures in memory.

Note that this solution assumes that the input indices are valid and correspond to nodes in the binary tree. If the input indices are invalid or do not correspond to nodes in the tree, the behavior of the solution is undefined.
