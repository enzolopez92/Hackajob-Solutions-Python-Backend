# What Day Is It

Wouldn't it be neat if every year, your birthday would fall on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday?
Given a certain date, return a string with the day of the week and the year it will fall in a weekend, starting with the year (2016). Do this for 50 years in the future.

## INPUT: 

string    date_of_birth
                ^ with this format: dd-mm

## OUTPUT:
string    future_dates
                ^ wday-yyyy wday-yyyy …
                (where _wday_ can be any of this three values: Fry, Sat, Sun)
                Every date should be separated by one space.

## EXAMPLE: 

### Input
"23-10"

### Output
"Sun-2016 Fri-2020 Sat-2021 Sun-2022 Fri-2026 Sat-2027 Sat-2032 Sun-2033 Fri-2037 Sat-2038 Sun-2039 Fri-2043 Sun-2044 Fri-2048 Sat-2049 Sun-2050 Fri-2054 Sat-2055 Sat-2060 Sun-2061 Fri-2065".
